# Hands On


## Planning our network setup

Before we deploy our application to ECS, we need to think about the networking.

It's best practice to have the todo-service in private subnets, so we also want to place it in them.

The endpoint of our public database resolves to a public IP address.
While possible to have our traffic go via the internet, we now have both our resources in the same VPC, so we want to have them communicate with each other via private IP addresses.

That approach ...

- increases security, as no traffic is routed via the public internet
- reduces costs, as we don't pay for egress traffic
- reduces attack surface, as we don't have public IP addresses

So, we need to move the database to the private subnets as well.
Sadly, AWS doesn't support moving resources from one subnet to another after they've been created.
This means, we need to delete the `databaseStack` before recreating it in the private subnets.

Trigger this deletion now manually via the CloudFormation console.


## Moving the database to private subnets

In the `lib/database-stack.ts` file, change the `subnetType` of the database to `PRIVATE_WITH_EGRESS`.
Before we can deploy this, the stack deletion needs to complete. This will take a few minutes.
In the meantime, we can already prepare a new stack for the todo service.

Add a new stack in a new file `lib/ecs-stack.ts` with the following code:

```typescript
import * as cdk from 'aws-cdk-lib';
import { Vpc } from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-ec2';
import { Cluster } from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-ecs';
import { Construct } from 'constructs';

interface EcsStackProps extends cdk.StackProps {
  vpc: Vpc;
}

export class EcsStack extends cdk.Stack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props?: EcsStackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    const cluster = new Cluster(this, 'EcsCluster', {
      vpc: props?.vpc,
      enableFargateCapacityProviders: true,
    });
  }
}

```

As with the databaseStack, make sure to import and add the new stack to the `bin/cdk.ts` file and pass the `vpc` property:

```typescript
// ...
import { EcsStack } from '../lib/ecs-stack';
// ...
const ecsStack = new EcsStack(app, 'EcsStack', {
  env: { account: process.env.CDK_DEFAULT_ACCOUNT, region: 'eu-central-1' },
  vpc: vpcStack.vpc,
});
```

Wait until the database stack deletion is complete, then deploy your changes.

When you deploy this later, you'll see in the RDS console that the new database is now running in a private subnet.
You won't be able to connect to it from your local machine anymore, no matter the security group rules.


## Preparing the security groups

Open the ECS console and you'll see an empty ECS cluster running already.
Since it's a Fargate cluster, it doesn't cost anything, as we aren't running any tasks yet.

Previously, we created a security group rule to allow access to the database from our own IP address manually.
Now, we'll automate the security group rule for the ECS-hosted todo-service.
For that, we need both security groups in one Stack. It's better to set up the necessary security group rule in the EcsStack, since it's the one that depends on the database and not the other way around.

We could pass the whole database object to the ECS stack, or just the security group. Both would work, but the former breaches the least-privilege principle.
Even better than the security group, we can pass the `Connections` property of the database cluster, which contains the security group of the database and provides some helper functions around it.

Similar to the `vpc` object from the VPC stack earlier, first expose the `Connections` object from the database stack to the ECS stack by making the following changes:

```typescript
export class DatabaseStack extends cdk.Stack {
  public dbCredentialsSecret: ISecret;
  public databaseConnections: IConnectable;

  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props?: DatabaseStackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    // ...

    this.dbCredentialsSecret = dbCluster.secret!;
    this.databaseConnections = dbCluster.connections;
  }
}
```

Don't forget the necessary imports.
Then, add the `databaseConnections` to the props of the EcsStack in the `lib/ecs-stack.ts` file:

```typescript
// ...
import { IConnectable, Vpc } from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-ec2';
// ...
interface EcsStackProps extends cdk.StackProps {
  vpc: Vpc;
  databaseConnections: IConnectable;
}
```

Finally, pass the `databaseConnections` from the Database stack to the ECS stack in the `bin/cdk.ts` file:

```typescript
const ecsStack = new EcsStack(app, "EcsStack", {
  env: { account: process.env.CDK_DEFAULT_ACCOUNT, region: "eu-central-1" },
  vpc: vpcStack.vpc,
  databaseConnections: databaseStack.databaseConnections,
});
```

Alright, the `Connections` object is now being passed to the ECS stack. We'll work with it in the next step.
Wait for the DatabaseStack deletion to complete and then deploy all changes with `cdk deploy --all`.


## Deploying the todo-service to ECS

Since we've created a new database, don't forget to update the connection string in the `todo-service/src/database.ts` file with the new url and credentials.

Now, the only thing that's still missing is the todo-service itself.
Add the following lines to the ECS Stack constructor in the `lib/ecs-stack.ts` file, right after the `cluster` variable declaration:

```typescript
const albFargateService = new ApplicationLoadBalancedFargateService(
  this,
  'TodoService',
  {
    cluster,
    cpu: 512,
    memoryLimitMiB: 1024,
    desiredCount: 1,
    taskImageOptions: {
      image: ContainerImage.fromAsset('../todo-service', {
        platform: Platform.LINUX_AMD64,
        exclude: ['node_modules'],
      }),
      containerPort: 3000,
      logDriver: new AwsLogDriver({
        streamPrefix: 'ecs/todo-service',
      }),
    },
    taskSubnets: {
      subnetType: SubnetType.PRIVATE_WITH_EGRESS,
    },
    propagateTags: PropagatedTagSource.SERVICE,
  }
);

albFargateService.service.connections.allowToDefaultPort(
  props!.databaseConnections
);
```

Necessary imports can be found in `aws-cdk-lib/aws-ec2`, `aws-cdk-lib/aws-ecr-assets`, `aws-cdk-lib/aws-ecs`, and `aws-cdk-lib/aws-ecs-patterns`.

It's the most complex object we've used so far. So let's break it down:

- `cluster` is the ECS cluster we created earlier. Normally, it'd be `cluster: cluster`, but when both sides have the same name in typescript, we can shorten it.
- `cpu` is _not_ the amount of CPU cores, but rather a CPU unit value where 1024 units = 1 vCPU. These units are sometimes also called "millicores".
  More insights can be found in the [AWS docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_ecs_patterns.ApplicationLoadBalancedFargateService.html#cpu).
- `memoryLimitMiB` is the maximum amount of memory in MiB that the ECS-task is allowed to use. It is also what you'll pay for. Check the link on `cpu` about allowed combinations of `cpu` and `memoryLimitMiB`.
- `taskImageOptions` is the configuration for the container image.
  - `image` is the container image we want to use. In this case, we run the `docker build` command from the specified path, while excluding the `node_modules` folder.
    Make sure this fits your folder structure.
  - `containerPort` is the port on which the container is listening for traffic.
  - `logDriver` is optional, but necessary if we want to set the log retention time - default is forever.
    - `streamPrefix` is the prefix for the log group.
- `taskSubnets` is the subnet in which the task is placed.
  - `subnetType` is the type of subnet. Here, we don't make the todo-service public, so it's placed in a private subnet. The `WITH_EGRESS` referes to outgoing internet access. Depending on your application, that might or might not be necessary.
- `propagateTags` tells AWS to propagate the tags from the service to its tasks. Otherwise, the tasks would have no tags. Although not necessary here, it's a good practice to set it to `PropagatedTagSource.SERVICE`.

The `allowDefaultPortFrom` function in the last line of the codeblock refers to our security groups: We allow (the security group of) the todo-service to access the database (security group) on the database's default port (5432). Isn't that magical?! No need to care about IP ranges, security group names, ports, etc.

Deploy the changes now. If you run into issues, please consult the next section below.

You can follow the deployment along in the CloudFormation console and the ECS console.
During/After the deployment, also check the status and logs of the todo-service.


## Troubleshooting

The object is complex, and it's easy to make a mistake. Also, cross-platform compatibility issues can be additional pain. Here are some common issues:

If you get an error that says something like `Cannot find image directory`, make sure you set the `image` property correctly. It needs to point to the directory containing the `Dockerfile`.

If you get an error that says something like `400 Bad Request` and you're using Docker Desktop, make sure you set the cross-platform parameters correctly, disable containerd in Docker Engine, and delete any existing images in the ECR repository.

If you the deployment takes >10 minutes, check the ECS console about failed tasks and their logs.
Should you see a status message that says `Essential container in task exited`, it means there was an application error.
If you find a log message that says `Database connection failed`, make sure to check the credentials against the secret manager.

By default, CloudFormation will timeout and fail after 1 hour. If you identified an issue, and want to redeploy earlier, you can manually cancel the stack update. For fresh/new stacks that are being deployed for the first time, there is no such option. Delete the whole stack instead.

If everything went well, the todo-service should now print the very relieving message `Database connected!` to the logs.
Nice work!


## About that `ApplicationLoadBalancedFargateService`

You might have noticed that we deployed an `ApplicationLoadBalancedFargateService` instead of a `FargateService`.
This small difference automagically created a loadbalancer for us - in a public subnet.
Yes, you read right - no further configuration needed.
Open the EC2 console now and check out that new shiny loadbalancer.

But wait, isn't there a DNS entry in the loadbalancer? Go check it out in your browser (http only ;) ).
Yay! Our service is already accessible from the outside!

When did that happen?
If you go into the loadbalancer's Listeners and Rules section, you'll find a listener for port 80 and a rule that forwards all traffic to the target group.
If you then click onto that rule, you'll find there's only a default one, which forwards traffic to a target group.
And the target group contains a single entry, which is listens on port 3000 - our ECS-task.

That's the magic of the `ApplicationLoadBalancedFargateService`!


## Health Checks

Still on the target group, you can find a tab called `Health checks`.
At the moment, it's configured to make a health check every 30 seconds, it requires a 200 response from the targets traffic port (3000) and 5 consecutive successful health checks before a task is considered healthy. And it will reach out to `/` on the todo-service.

In most cases, `/` will return more than just our `Hello World` message, so it's impractial to use it for health checks.
It's common practice to create a dedicated health check route, like `/health`, which returns a simple `ok` message.
Keep in mind, that the endpoint should only check the health of the application, not of any dependencies. Else, when a dependency is down, the application cannot be deployed any more.

Add the following line to the `todo-service/src/routes/todoRoutes.ts` file:

```typescript
router.get("/health", (req, res) => {
  res.send("ok");
});
```

In the `/cdk/lib/ecs-stack.ts` file, add the following lines to the constructor of the `EcsStack` class, for example after the `allowToDefaultPort` line:

```typescript
albFargateService.targetGroup.configureHealthCheck({
  path: '/health',
});
```

With the parameters of this method, you can configure other parameters here, too. Like decreasing the healthy-threshold from 5 to 3, or the default timeout from 5 seconds to 1 second.

Deploy the new configuration now.

Verify your settings in the target group's health check section. You can find this in the target group's description in the EC2 console.


## Architecture diagram

Here's an architecture diagram of the resulting setup:

![Architecture diagram](../../media/architecture.drawio.svg)

In this diagram, you can see the VPC, the subnets, the loadbalancer, the ECS cluster, the ECS task, and the RDS database.

Sidenote:
Keep in mind that the ECS task only runs in one AZ at the moment, as we only have one instance so far. Although it's undefined which one that is, therefore it's pictured in all AZs in the diagram.
For the Database it's similar, but it's one managed cluster running in all AZs, so it's a box across all AZs, but a single icon.
